# Ford-GoBike-System-Data
## Introduction:



In this project we will look at the Ford GoBike System Data.This dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in jaunary 2019. The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data.
I will focus on these five questions. The first question is what the most day that people use a bike. The second question, What is the start time that people pick the bike. The third question is which days people use the bike for a long time. The fourth question is the top 5 station that is more people get the bike to go for a ride. The last question is looking for the customer and Subscriber which one of these two types will use the bike more frequency.




##Summary:
In conclusion, we can see that people use the bike in workdays more than weekend days. Besides, the most day that people go for a ride is Thursday and Wednesday. Also, it seems that at the weekend people use the bike in a long time than the other days. It clear that the customer uses the bike more than people who have a subscriber. Also, we can conclude that the average duration of the rides is higher in customer than who have a subscriber. finally The best station was San Francisco Caltrain Station 2.
